/*
 * Denotes a batch of HTTP requests to be sent to an HTTP server all together.
 * @ingroup TransportLayerCore
 *
 * Batch requests are encoded together as a multipart/mixed message whose
 * parts are the individual messages being batched. The batch message is
 * POSTed to a webserver URL that is capable of handling such a message,
 * which is not standard. The Google Cloud Platform provides a URL intended
 * for batching requests to Google APIs. This class is intended to be used
 * for that purpose.
 *
 * HttpRequestBatch acts as an HttpRequest factory for the requests to be
 * batched. Ideally you know at the time of construction whether you are
 * going to batch an HttpRequest or not. If you are going to batch it then
 * you need to construct it from the BatchHttpRequest that it will live in.
 * If it isnt to be batched then you need to construct it from the
 * HttpTransport that you will use to send it. The HttpRequestBatch provides
 * a method in which you can add any existing HttpRequest, including one
 * that was created directly from a transport. However this method will
 * destroy the old request and create a new copy in its place, thus invaliding
 * the old pointer (and corrupting any other references to it).
 *
 * The HttpRequestBatch is constructed with a transport instance that it will
 * use for the actualy HTTP messaging of the batch.
 *
 * To customize the actual HTTP message sent, such as setting a default
 * credential, headers, or HttpRequestOptions, get the underlying http_request
 * object through the mutable_http_request() attribute. The HttpRequest can
 * also be used to inspect HTTP details within the response, such as overall
 * status. The individual batched HttpRequests can also be inspected.
 *
 * TODO(user): 20130823
 * Need to refactor HttpScribe to know about batched requests so that it
 * can censor the individual parts in the batch rather than them as an
 * opaque stream. As it stands header censorship wont work because it
 * doesnt know about the headers inside the batched body content.
