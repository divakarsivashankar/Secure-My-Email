/*
 * @defgroup ClientServiceLayer Client Service Layer
 *
 * The Client Service Layer provides application-level support for interacting
 * with Google Cloud Platform services and endpoints. It makes use of the
 * HTTP Transport Layer for the actual messaging and response handling but
 * hides these low level details with higher level abstractions specialized
 * for specific use cases.
 *
 * Much of this layer is geared around the consumption of services that present
 * REST-style interfaces.
 *
 * Typically programmers use the Google APIs Code Generator to generate a
 * C++ library specific to the service(s) they will be using. The output
 * of the code generator are libraries built ontop of the offerings in this
 * module.
 *
 * The client service layer also includes additional helper classes such as
 * the ServiceRequestPager for paging through large resources using finer
 * granularity requests.

/*
 * Base class for requests made to a ClientService.
 * @ingroup ClientServiceLayer
 *
 * This class is based on a Command Pattern. The instance is given the service
 * endpoint to invoke and is given the arguments to invoke with as expected
 * by that endpoint. When its Execute() method is called, it will invoke
 * the command and wait for the response. The caller can get any response
 * data as well as the overall status from the request instance.
 *
 * When using the code generator to create custom APIs for a given service,
 * the code generator will subclass these requests for each endpoint API.
 * The specialized subclasses will contain higher level methods for setting
 * the various arguments and parameters that are available to use. Those
 * class instances are created using the ClientService instance (i.e. the
 * ClientService acts as a ClientServiceRequest factory. Therefore this class
 * is not typically explicitly instantiated. Lower level code may use this
 * class directly since it is concrete and fully capable.
 *
 * You should not explicitly destroy this class (or derived classes) when
 * making asynchronous requests unless you know that the request has
 * completely finished executing (its underlying HttpRequest is done).
 * It is safest to use DestroyWhenDone() instead. Otherwise code on the stack
 * may still be referencing the instance after it is destroyed, and your
 * program will crash.
 *
 * Requests are given a service and
 * <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570'>RFC 6570</a>
 * URI Template to invoke within that service. The purpose of the URI
 * template is to ultimately provide the URL within the service. The
 * request instance can resolve the parameters in the template. This is
 * described in more detail with the PrepareUrl() method.
